# TypeScript Library

This first commit has a working configuration of TypeScript, ESLint, and Jest. Should be suitable for creating widely-compatible non-React packages.

Note that the generated code is CommonJS and not ESModules. This allows your library to be imported by code which is not written as an ESModule.
